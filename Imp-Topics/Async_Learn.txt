Asyncio stands for asynchronous input output and refers to a programming paradigm which achieves high concurrency using
a single thread or event loop.

Why use asyncio instead of multithreading in Python?
Itâ€™s very difficult to write code that is thread safe. With asynchronous code, you know exactly where the code will shift
from one task to the next and race conditions are much harder to come by.

Threads consume a fair amount of data since each thread needs to have its own stack. With async code, all the code shares
the same stack and the stack is kept small due to continuously unwinding the stack between tasks.

Threads are OS structures and therefore require more memory for the platform to support. There is no such problem with
asynchronous tasks.
